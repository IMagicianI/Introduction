# Introduction
  This organization was created as an *unofficial* place for Uppsala University students to share their work and notes when appropriate. Originally created by and for the 2015 Computational Msc. group, everyone studying in Uppsala is free to join. Just send an email to github.com-at-codingcat.nl using your student email.
# Organization
  There is no strict organization or file hierarchy at the moment, but repos relating to courses should be named *fullname-CourseCode*, and should contain things such as student notes, answers to exercises, code-snippets, lectures, and whatever else might be useful to current or future students. Note that any course material might be copyrighted to the professor or whomever is responsible. Please clear it with them before uploading such files.
  If you prefer to keep your work in a personal repository, you can add it to the course-repo as a submodule, or simple include a link to your repo. 
  Repos not relating to any course, such as this one, are allowed as long as they are (vaguely) relevant to students at Uppsala. It does not have to be purely academical, feel free to make a repo with a list of the best pubs in Uppsala.
  Please note that anything posted to this group is public.

# Copyright
 Please do not upload or directly link to copyright infringing content (e.g. pirated  textbooks), however feel free to mention if it is possible to find one ;).
<!---TODO: Add a bit about how to use Github/git, inquire about the distribution rights on assigments, examples.-->
