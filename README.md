# Introduction
  This organization was created as an *unofficial* place for Uppsala University students to share their work and notes when appropriate. Originally created by and for the 2015 Computational Msc. group, everyone studying in Uppsala is free to join. Just send an email to github.com-at-codingcat.nl using your student email.
# Organization
  There is no strict orginazation or hierarchy at the moment. It is recommend to make a repo per course, and use sub-directories per year/student if required. Note that everything in this group is public to the whole world, if you wish to make private modifications feel free to fork the corresponding repository.

# Copyright
 Please do not upload or directly link to copyright infringing content (e.g. pirated  textbooks), however feel free to mention if it is possible to find one ;).
<!---TODO: Add a bit about how to use Github/git, licensing information, inquire about the distribution rights on assigments, examples.-->
