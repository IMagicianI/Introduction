# Introduction
  This organization was created as an *unofficial* place for Uppsala University students to share their work, notes and other useful information. Originally created by and for the 2015 Computational Msc. group, everyone is free to join.

# terms
For those of you unfamiliar with Git(Hub), here is a quick-rundown of some lingo:
* Git : The technology used to share & collaborate on files.
* Repository : A collection of files, kind of like a folder, in this case we use a single repository per course.
* Commit : Save any changes you have made and take a snapshot of all the files. This can serve as a back-up as well as a log 
   of 'who changed what'. Did you or someone else mess something up? Just undo their commit.
* Push/Pull : Putting your (commited) changes up on Github and getting any changes from Github respectively.
* Clone : Copying a whole repo to your harddrive so you can work on it locally. Often the first step when you want to start working on something.
* Fork : Make your own copy of a repo on Github. Usually done when you want to make some personal/big changes. When you are done with those changes you can issue a pull request to have your changes be added to the original, or you can just keep them for yourself if you wish. 

# Setting Up
In order to post comments/take part in discussions you will need a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) (free), that's it. If you're on Windows or Mac, I recommend you download [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to easily download and work on files, if you're on Linux you're probably technical enough to figure out [how to use Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/#platform-linux) yourself ;-).

In order to easily add new files and repositories (courses) you need to be added to the group, simply drop a comment [here](https://github.com/UppsalaStudents/Introduction/issues/1) and you'll be added as soon as possible. Note that everyone who's already a member can add anyone to the group, so you can also ask anyone you know directly.

# Usage

## File management
For courses, this group is inteded to be used to help eachother with questions & problems, as well as share any notes, snippets, answers that might be useful to people. Add anything you like, but try and keep things organized & working.

 To get a personal copy of all the files in a repo, simply hit the "Download as Zip" button (shown below). This does not even require an account.
 
To add or change files hit the fork button in the top right corner, then select you username. This will add an exact clone of the repo to your personal account. Go to that repo and copy it to your computer using the clone button (requires [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) ).

If you're on a linux machine, or prefer the command line, you can use "git clone theUrlAboveTheButton". Any changes you make will automatically show up in the Github Desktop client. Simply hit "Uncommited changes" to show them, hit commit to master (this makes a snapshot on your local computer) and finally hit sync to put your changes back online.

If you're working in a group, have a look at [adding collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/) to see how you can have it so everyone can work on the same repo. 

If you'd ever like to make any changes to the group's repository: either do as above and hit 'pull request' either on Github.com or the client or simply skip the forking step above and commit directly to the shared repo. Be sure not to overwrite or delete anyhing of value or your changes will be undone (and if it happens regularly, your write permissions might be revoked). 

## Chatting, Questions & Issues

For questions or issues, you can use the issues tab, which work like a forum: ![issues tab](/images/issues.png?raw=true) and hopefully a kind student or instructor will come and help you. By default, people recieve notifications when a new issues is created. 

For quick questions or a bit of banter, you can use Gitter, this is an instant messaging service which automatically uses your github account. To join a chatroom, simple press the Gitter button that should be at the top of each repo's readme. 


# Organization
  There is no strict organization or file hierarchy at the moment, but repos relating to courses should be named *fullname-CourseCode*, and should contain things such as student notes, answers to exercises, code-snippets, lectures, and whatever else might be useful to current or future students. Note that any course material might be copyrighted to the professor or whomever is responsible. Please clear it with them before uploading such files.
  
  Repos not relating to any course, such as this one, are allowed as long as they are (vaguely) relevant to students at Uppsala. It does not have to be purely academical, feel free to make a repo with a list of the best pubs in Uppsala.
  
  Please note that anything posted to this group, both files and comments, are public.

# Copyright
 Please do not upload or directly link to copyright infringing content (e.g. pirated  textbooks), and make sure to get permission before uploading lectures and the like.

#FAQ
* I just want to get the files, do I have to go through all of this?
  No, you can just hit the "Download as zip" button to the side of a repository and get all the files in there, you don't even need an account.

* Why?
  Why not? Sharing is caring after all.

* Why Github?

 It's free (no one is paying us to maintain this...), and makes it easy to share files between a large number of people. While it is true the user friendliness could be improved for non-technical users there is as far as we're aware no easy-to-deploy free service which allows unlimited people & files. Also, if you're in an IT program, an active GitHub profile will look nice on your resume ;).

* Pa svenska?
  Jag pratar inte svenska :(
